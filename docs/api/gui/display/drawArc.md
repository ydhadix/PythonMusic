# drawArc()

Draw an arc straight onto the display.

```python
display.drawArc(x1, y1, x2, y2)
```

The arc is part of the oval that fills the box with corners (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). Angles are in degrees, with 0 at the three o'clock position; a positive angle goes counter-clockwise, a negative one clockwise. The constants HALF_PI, PI, and TWO_PI may be used for the angles. This draws to the canvas and returns nothing, which is fast and best for shapes you will not change later. To keep a handle you can move or delete, create an Arc and [add()](add.md) it instead. Erase these drawings with [clearDrawing()](clearDrawing.md).

## Parameters

```python
display.drawArc(x1, y1, x2, y2, startAngle=PI, endAngle=TWO_PI, style=OPEN, color=Color.BLACK, fill=False, thickness=1, rotation=0)
```

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `x1` | `int or float` | _required_ | The horizontal position of the box's top-left corner, in pixels. |
| `y1` | `int or float` | _required_ | The vertical position of the box's top-left corner, in pixels. |
| `x2` | `int or float` | _required_ | The horizontal position of the box's bottom-right corner, in pixels. |
| `y2` | `int or float` | _required_ | The vertical position of the box's bottom-right corner, in pixels. |
| `startAngle` | `int or float` | `PI` | The starting angle, in degrees. |
| `endAngle` | `int or float` | `TWO_PI` | The ending angle, in degrees. |
| `style` | `int` | `OPEN` | The arc style, one of OPEN (an open arc), CHORD (closed with a straight line between the ends), or PIE (closed with two lines to the center). |
| `color` | `Color` | `Color.BLACK` | The color. |
| `fill` | `bool` | `False` | Whether the arc is filled in (True) or just an outline (False). |
| `thickness` | `int` | `1` | The outline thickness, in pixels. |
| `rotation` | `int or float` | `0` | How far to turn the arc, in degrees, counter-clockwise. |
