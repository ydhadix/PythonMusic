# drawIcon()

Draw an icon straight onto the display.

This draws to the canvas and returns nothing, which is fast and best for images you will not change later. To keep a handle you can move or delete, create an [Icon](../icon/index.md) and [add()](../common/collection/add.md) it instead.

Erase these drawings with [clearDrawing()](clearDrawing.md).

## Parameters

Once an object `display` has been created, you can use the following functions:

```python
display.drawIcon(filename, x, y)
```

```python
display.drawIcon(filename, x, y, width, height, rotation, visibility)
```
