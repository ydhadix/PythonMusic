# drawLine()

Draw a line straight onto the display.

This draws to the canvas and returns nothing, which is fast and best for shapes you will not change later. To keep a handle you can move or delete, create a [Line](../shapes/line/index.md) and [add()](../common/collection/add.md) it instead.

Erase these drawings with [clearDrawing()](clearDrawing.md).

## Parameters

Once an object `display` has been created, you can use the following functions:

```python
display.drawLine(x1, y1, x2, y2)
```

```python
display.drawLine(x1, y1, x2, y2, color, thickness, rotation, visibility)
```
