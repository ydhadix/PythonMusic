## Event Functions

Event functions are used to set callback functions that are called whenever something happens, such as the mouse moving or a key being pressed.

### Mouse Events

See [Mouse Events](../event/mouse/index.md) for more information on how to use mouse events.

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| [`onMouseClick(action)`](events/mouse/onMouseClick.md) | Register a function to call when the mouse is clicked (pressed down and released) on this object. |
| [`onMouseDown(action)`](events/mouse/onMouseDown.md) | Register a function to call when the mouse button is pressed on this object. |
| [`onMouseUp(action)`](events/mouse/onMouseUp.md) | Register a function to call when the mouse button is released over this object. |
| [`onMouseMove(action)`](events/mouse/onMouseMove.md) | Register a function to call when the mouse moves over this object. |
| [`onMouseDrag(action)`](events/mouse/onMouseDrag.md) | Register a function to call when the mouse is dragged over this object. |
| [`onMouseEnter(action)`](events/mouse/onMouseEnter.md) | Register a function to call when the mouse moves onto this object. |
| [`onMouseExit(action)`](events/mouse/onMouseExit.md) | Register a function to call when the mouse moves off this object. |

### Keyboard Events

See [Keyboard Events](../event/keyboard/index.md) for more information on how to use keyboard events.

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| [`onKeyType(action)`](events/keyboard/onKeyType.md) | Register a function to call when a key is typed (pressed and released). |
| [`onKeyDown(action)`](events/keyboard/onKeyDown.md) | Register a function to call when a key is pressed down. |

### Display Events

See [Display Events](../event/display/index.md) for more information on how to use display events.

## Collection Functions

Collection functions are used by [Displays](../display/index.md) and [Groups](../group/index.md) to manage the objects they contain.

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| [`add(item)`](collection/add.md) | Add an object to the collection. |

| [`removeAll()`](collection/removeAll.md) | Remove every object from the collection. |
| [`getOrder(item)`](collection/getOrder.md) | Return the layer an object sits on within the collection. |
| [`setOrder(item, order)`](collection/setOrder.md) | Move an object to a different layer within the collection. |
| [`getItems()`](collection/getItems.md) | Return the objects currently in the collection. |
