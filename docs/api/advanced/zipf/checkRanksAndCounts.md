# checkRanksAndCounts()

Check that ranks and counts are valid for a Zipf measurement.

```python
checkRanksAndCounts(ranks, counts)
```

Confirms that both lists hold at least one item, are the same length, and contain no zero or negative values. On bad input, prints an error rather than raising.

## Parameters

```

|---|---|---|---|
| `ranks` | `list[int or float]` | _required_ | The rank (the x value) for each count. |
| `counts` | `list[int or float]` | _required_ | How often each item occurs. |
