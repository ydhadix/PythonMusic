# Write

You can create a MIDI file from your program using the [Write.midi()](midi.md) function. This function expects a [Score](../../transcription/score/index.md) ([Part](../../transcription/part/index.md), [Phrase](../../transcription/phrase/index.md), or [Note](../../transcription/note/index.md)) and a file name.

## Functions

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| [`Write.midi(material, filename)`](midi.md) | Write music library material to a MIDI file. |

For example,

```python
Write.midi(score, "song.mid")
```

writes the musical data in score into the MIDI file called “song.mid”. This file is saved in the same folder as your program. If the MIDI file already exists, it will be overwritten.
