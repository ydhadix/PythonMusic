# PEM — deferred work / open questions

A catalogue of loose ends still in the tree as of the 2026-05 refactor: things
deliberately left for later, dormant features, small cleanups, and the
in-source `TODO`/`XXX` markers worth a decision. Each item is "implement or
abandon" — nothing here is load-bearing. Companion to `PEM_REFACTOR_PLAN.md`
(repo root), which tracks the refactor itself.

---

## 1. Refactor follow-ups

- **Split `pemlib/pyshell.py`.** `ModifiedInterpreter`, `PyShell`, and
  `main()` still share one ~2 kloc module. Splitting (e.g. `shell/interpreter.py`
  + `shell/pyshell.py` + a small `shell/app.py` for `main()`) was judged
  valuable-but-riskier and skipped. — *implement or abandon*
- **Trim `pyshell.main()`'s dead CLI parsing.** PEM always launches it as
  `pyshell.main()` with `argv = ["PEM", "-e", <file?>]`. The `-n` (no
  subprocess), `-s`/`PEMSTARTUP`/`PYTHONSTARTUP`, `-i`, `-c cmd`, `-r file`,
  and `-` (stdin) branches — plus the long `usage_msg` string — are inherited
  from IDLE and unreachable in normal use. Decide whether to keep `-n`
  (no-subprocess mode still half-works) and delete the rest, or leave it. —
  *implement or abandon*
- **`perflog.py` once the dust settles.** The `PEM_PERF`-gated latency
  harness (`pemlib/perflog.py` + `perflog.mark(...)` calls scattered through
  `pyshell.py`, `execution/run.py`, `editing/editor.py`, `editing/runscript.py`)
  exists to diagnose the startup-lag refactor. Decide: keep as a permanent
  diagnostic, gate it tighter, or strip it out (and the call sites). —
  *implement or abandon*
- **Test suite.** The IDLE-derived `pemlib/pem_test/` was removed (mostly
  broken pre-refactor, not worth fixing piecemeal). A fresh suite is to be
  written later — both for the new machinery (pre-warm spare pool,
  `restart_subprocess` promotion, `active_sink` output routing, the per-tab
  output pane) and for whatever editor behaviour is worth pinning down.
- **Dead `if __name__ == '__main__'` blocks.** ~45 modules still end with an
  `if __name__ == '__main__': ... main('pemlib.pem_test.test_X', ...)`
  (and some `from pemlib.pem_test.htest import run`) block, inherited from
  IDLE — now importing a package that no longer exists. Inert in normal use
  (only runs on `python -m pemlib.<x>`), but cruft. Strip them, or leave
  until the new test suite lands. — *implement or abandon*

## 2. Dormant / non-functional features

- **Create Executable.** `pemlib/editing/exebuilder.py` has a
  `# WORK IN PROGRESS` banner — the feature is wired to a toolbar button
  (`EditorWindow.toolbar_create_executable`) but is not functional. The menu
  item (`('Create _Executable', '<<create-executable>>')` in
  `mainmenu.py`) is commented out. Decide: fix it, or remove it (the toolbar
  button, the binding, `exebuilder.py`, and the `packages.py` build profiles it
  would use). — *implement or abandon*
- **`OnDemandOutputWindow`** in `pemlib/shell/outwin.py` — a dead class with
  a `# These classes are currently not used but might come in handy` header. —
  *abandon (delete) unless a use appears*
- **Pause-while-running.** `('_Pause', '<<pause>>')` is commented out in
  `mainmenu.py` ("functionality not yet implemented"). There is no Pause
  mechanism for a running subprocess. — *implement or abandon*
- **`codecontext` / `zoomheight`** (`pemlib/editing/`) are active, working
  features but have no menu items (the whole `('options', [...])` cascade in
  `mainmenu.py` is commented out, as is the Format cascade). Decide whether to
  surface them in a menu or leave them keyboard/preference-only. — *implement or
  abandon*
- **Turtle Demo menu item** — commented out at the bottom of `mainmenu.py`
  (`# if find_spec('turtledemo'): ...`). — *implement or abandon*

## 3. Small cleanups

- **`Icons/` vs `icons/` directory case duplication.** `pemlib/` has both
  `Icons/` (app icons, read by `help_about.py` and `pyshell.main()`) and
  `icons/` (toolbar glyphs, read by `editing/editor.py`). On a
  case-insensitive filesystem these collide; consolidate to one. — *implement or
  abandon*
- **About dialog still half-IDLE.** `pemlib/help_about.py` shows
  "Python's Integrated Development and Learning Environment", a `discuss.python.org`
  link, and a `docs.python.org/.../pem.html` link (no such page). The
  Readme/News/Credits buttons read `pemlib/README.txt` / `News3.txt` /
  `CREDITS.txt`, which are still the IDLE-derived files. Rewrite the dialog and
  those three text files for PEM, or trim the dialog down. — *implement or
  abandon*
- **Error-message strings that point at IDLE docs.** `ModifiedInterpreter`'s
  `display_no_subprocess_error` / `display_port_binding_error` reference
  `docs.python.org/3/library/pem.html` and "Run PEM with the -n command
  line switch ... Help/PEM Help 'Running without a subprocess'". Reword or
  point somewhere real. — *implement or abandon*
- **`config/configdialog.py:82`** — `# XXX Decide whether to keep or delete
  these key bindings.` (an inherited IDLE marker, but a real decision). —
  *implement or abandon*

## 4. In-source `TODO` / `XXX` markers

### PEM-authored or PEM-relevant

- `pemlib/mainmenu.py:19` — `# TODO: Make this more robust` (the
  `macosx.overrideRootMenu` mutates `menudefs` in place; fragile).
- `pemlib/mainmenu.py:75` — `('_Pause', ...)` — see §2.
- `pemlib/mainmenu.py` §60-69, §92-98 — commented-out Format and Options
  cascades — see §2.
- `pemlib/shell/sidebar.py:42` — `# TODO: use also in codecontext.py`
  (the line-number gutter width logic could be shared).
- `pemlib/shell/sidebar.py:100` — `"""Placeholder for color synchronization
  in subclasses."""` — `update_colors` base method is a no-op.
- `pemlib/util.py:9-13` — the module docstring's `TODO:` list (consolidate
  more cross-module shared bits — Python/tk version strings, std streams,
  warnings helpers — into `util.py`). Inherited from idlelib but still applies.

### Inherited from idlelib (low priority — present in upstream too)

These came in with the IDLE fork and aren't PEM-specific; listed for
completeness, almost certainly *abandon* unless touching that code anyway:

- `pemlib/pyshell.py:72` — `PORT = 0  # someday pass in host, port for
  remote debug capability`.
- `pemlib/pyshell.py:1084` — `# XXX KBK 27Dec07 use text viewer someday, but
  must work w/o subproc` (paging `help()` output).
- `pemlib/config/config.py` — ~12 `# TODO`/`XXX` markers (lines 26, 55, 160,
  212, 308, 441, 471, 548, 584, 603, 872, 878) — config-system robustness and
  test-coverage notes from 2014.
- `pemlib/searching/search.py:68` — `# TODO - why is this here and not in a
  create_command_buttons?`.
- `pemlib/searching/replace.py:150` — `# XXX ought to replace circular
  instead of top-to-bottom when wrapping`.
- `pemlib/execution/rpc.py:301,522,621` — `# XXX Check for other types`,
  a stray `## cgt xxx`, and `# XXX KBK 09Sep03 We need a proper unit test`.
- `pemlib/text/format.py:119,137,152,171` — paragraph-reformatting niceties.
- `pemlib/text/percolator.py:8,57` — Delegator inheritance / API musings.
- `pemlib/text/parenmatch.py:28`, `pemlib/text/undo.py:94` — minor notes.
- `pemlib/editing/tree.py` (header `# XXX TO DO:` plus lines 194, 201, 233,
  237, 420) and `pemlib/editing/browser.py` (header `XXX TO DO:`) — the
  module/class browser widgets; geometry constants, leaked bindings, missing
  icons.
- `pemlib/dialogs/query.py:202` — `# XXX Ought to insert current file's
  directory in front of path.` (the "run with args" path-entry dialog).
- `pemlib/shell/outwin.py:135` — `# XXX Should use PemPrefs.ColorPrefs`
  (inside the dead `OnDemandOutputWindow` — moot if that's deleted).
