# REVISIONS:
#
# 5.0   22-Jun-2026 (tb)   Ported from JythonMusic to PythonMusic.
#      - Replaced jMusic/jSyn backend
#         - MIDI synthesis is handled by tinysoundfont
#         - AudioSample now uses realtime sounddevice engine (RealtimeAudioPlayer)
#      - Natively implemented removed jMusic/jSyn structures:
#         - Fully implemented Note/Phrase/Part/Score
#         - Defined musical constants
#         - Read/Write now use mido for MIDI files, was jMusic I/O
#         - Ported and completed View using Verovio/matplotlib/pypianoroll
#      - Added full Google-style docstrings throughout
