#
# REVISIONS:
#
# 4.0   22-Jun-2026 (tb)   Ported from JythonMusic to PythonMusic.
#      - Replaced Java AWT/Swing backend with Qt (PySide6)
#      - Qt event loop runs in child process (GuiRenderer) via GuiHandler, never blocks user code
#         - Qt process is solely for rendering; calculations and canonical state
#           is handled in PythonMusic process
#      - Rebuilt widget hierarchy natively, was Swing subclasses plus Java listener classes:
#         - Interactable base for Display and Drawable
#         - Drawable/Graphics shapes: Rectangle, Oval, Circle, Arc, Polyline, Line, Polygon, Icon, Label
#         - Control widgets: Button, CheckBox, Slider, DropDownList, TextField, TextArea
#         - MusicControl group: HFader, VFader, Rotary, Push, Toggle, XYPad
#      - Added native Color and Font classes, were java.awt
#      - Major Drawable updates:
#         - Added Groups to move, rotate, and resize shapes as a unit
#         - Drawables are internally affine transform matrices
#         - Added rotation and visibility properties
#         - Added get/set size/width/height functions
#         - Added get/set center functions
#         - Added getEndpoints and getBoundingBox
#         - Added get/set length to Line
#         - Added Polyline class
#         - Added alpha channel to Icon get/set pixel functions
#      - Display draw methods now stamp to canvas, instead of creating interactive object
#      - colorGradient -> Color.gradient; uses OKLab transition
#      - Added full Google-style docstrings throughout
#
# TODO:
#    - Can we rotate Controls in Qt? (QWidgets)

# gui.py's display rendering, hit testing, and event handling is powered by Qt(PySide6).
# However, Qt's event loop blocks the python intepreter while its running.  Since Qt
# requires its event loop to be in the main thread, we offload it to a child process,
# which is managed by GuiHandler.  As a result, PythonMusic's user libraries never
# need to touch Qt.
# 
# NOTE: GuiHandler's components have mirrored versions of PythonMusic's visual
# objects to help with converting to Qt.  Future changes to gui's API may require
# updating those mirrored objects as well.

###### OKLab Gradient Interpolation
# Our color gradient logic is repurposed from David Koch's CITA / CSCI 284 code.
# His explanation of the program is preserved below:
#
# Notes:   \\\\\DAVID EXPLANATION/////
#        
#          WE WILL NOT HAVE GRAY IN BETWEEN YELLOW AND BLUE
#          this happens because Yellow is (225, 225, 0) and
#          Blue is (0, 0, 255) so in the middle they are gray (122, 122, 122)
#          (The above comment is describing a Standard RGB method (SRGB)
#          That is not how humans percieve light
#
#          What we want is a smooth brightness level
#          We have to convert SRBG to OKLab values then back to our traditional SRGB.
#
#          Convert RGB to Linear RGB (how light sort of works in real life/better for monitors)
#          to OKLab (the perceptual space) then blend and then
#          finally back to our RGB (which JythonMusic can read) for our number of columns.
#
#          The t variable later is used to smooth interpolation using a cosine curve.
#          (That specific calculation is recommended for any gradient calculation,
#          OKLab is just an extra step for a good digital gradient)
#          (AKA: Start and end smoothly)
#
#          What is LMS? The long, medium, and short cones in our eyes
#          OKLab simulates/needs it
#
#          TLDR:
#          We are going from SRGB to LRGB to LMS to OKLab and back
#          Each of them need the values from the previous
#
#          SRGB       - bad
#          Linear RGB - better
#          LMS        - human perception of color (gamma/brightness)
#          OKLab      - calculations to make it smooth for digital display
#
#
#          I did not come up with the calculations in documentation
#          I only brought them for my own program's "color correction"
#          I already have experience in OKLab before this assignment
#          through Gneiss Name's OKLab Minecraft world and personal projects
#          along with gamma correction calculations from 3D programs to photoshop

# Drawable - items that can be added to a Display
#######################################################################################
# Coordinate spaces and the scene graph
#######################################################################################
# Drawables are positioned in scene coordinates - where they sit on the Display the
# user can see.  Internally, though, each Drawable only remembers its placement
# relative to its parent (a Group, or the Display itself).  This keeps grouped items
# simple: moving or turning a Group just changes the Group's own placement and its
# children follow along, instead of every child having to be rewritten.
#
# To turn a parent-relative placement into a final on-screen placement, we combine each
# placement with its parent's, all the way up to the Display.  The helper functions
# below carry out that combining math so the rest of the file can work in terms of
# whole placements rather than the arithmetic behind them.
#
# ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# TECHNICAL NOTE - affine transforms (for maintainers extending this math)

# the parent's space:

#       | c  d  ty | . | y |
#       | 0  0   1 |   | 1 |
#
# The (tx, ty) column is the translation (the item's center); the (a b / c d) block is
# the combined rotation and scale.  Two placements combine by multiplying their
# matrices, so an item's on-screen placement is the product of every placement from the
# item up to the Display.  Our angles are CCW-positive in a y-down space - the opposite
# sense from the matrix's natural direction - so an angle is negated when it goes into a
# matrix and negated again when it is read back out.
